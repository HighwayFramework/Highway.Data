# About Highway Framework #
## Where did the Highway come from? ##
Highway.Data was built as a way to codify architectural patterns and practices that Tim Rayburn and Devlin Liles had learned through years of programming and consulting. 

The lessons that lead to building Highway where the same opinions that Tim and Devlin published as part of their book "[Entity Framework 4.1 : Expert's Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Entity-Framework-4-1-Experts-Cookbook/dp/1849684464 "Entity Framework 4.1 : Expert's Cookbook")". After publishing the book they both felt that they should create a re-usable way for people to avoid the pain that they had felt with Entity Framework. That work lead them to build Highway.Data.

The Highway Framework started out as just Highway.Data, but expanded as we found more and more boiler plate pieces of other technology areas. Now we have more areas where we can go from 0-Solving business problems much faster.

## Where does the Highway Go? ##
Highway Framework is not just code, but a set of interwoven patterns that allows a developer to get up to speed quickly on the infrastructure level stuff. When we start building or changing code we have to consider testability, logging, and re-use, and Highway aims to give you those parts for free.

Currently Highway includes on ramps for MVC and Services, in addition to Highway.Data. These are packages that you can nuget package install to a project to get up to speed incredibly quickly.

##Who built the highway?##
Tim Rayburn and Devlin Liles are the original core members of the Highway road crew, but several others have contributed to it's success. [Check out the rest of the contributors.](http://hwyfwk.com/team/index.html "Highway Road Crew ")

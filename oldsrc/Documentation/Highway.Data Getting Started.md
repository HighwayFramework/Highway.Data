#Getting Started#
So you want to get started with Highway.Data, but donâ€™t know where to start? Lets start the same place we always start with something new. "Tests!!!"

     [TestClass]
	 public class DriversEducationServiceTests
	 {
	    [TestMethod]
	    public void ShouldAddDriverByName()
	    {
	    //arrange
	    var context = new InMemoryDataContext();
	    var service = new DriversEducationService(new Repository(context));
	    
	    //act
    	service.AddDriver("Devlin");
    
    	//assert
    	context.AsQueryable<Driver>().Count(x => x.Name == "Devlin").Should().Be(1);
    	}
    }

Now that we have a test, lets work on an implementation. In this implementation we are going to focus on the patterns in Highway.Data. We will dive into Entity Framework, nHibernate, and RavenDb later. In order to facilitate this, we are going to use the InMemoryDataContext that ships with Highway.Data as our test stub.

We just need to add a driver to the database. 

    public class DriversEducationService
    {
        private readonly IRepository _repository;

        public DriversEducationService(IRepository repository)
        {
            _repository = repository;
        }

        public void AddDriver(string name)
        {
            _repository.Context.Add(new Driver(name));
        }
    }

    public class Driver
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public Driver(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }
    }
    
Once we have the repository, we can use the Context on Repository as a unit of work. Check [here](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html "Repository Pattern") and [here](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html "Unit of Work Pattern") read up on Repository or Unit of Work. 

This gives us the ability to separate the persistence from the business logic of our services.

Once we have added an object we will obviously need to query the object back out. For this we will need to use a mixture of [Specification Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern "Specification Pattern") and [Query Object Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/queryObject.html "Query Object Pattern"). Below is the test for querying back an object. 

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldQueryDriversByName()
    {
        //arrange 
        var context = new InMemoryDataContext();
        context.Add(new Driver("Devlin"));
        context.Add(new Driver("Tim"));

        var service = new DriversEducationService(new Repository(context));

        //act
        Driver driver = service.GetDriver("Devlin");

        //assert
        driver.Should().NotBeNull();
    }

And our service code that passes the test.

    public Driver GetDriver(string name)
    {
        return _repository.Find(new DriverByName(name));
    }
With the following query.

    public class DriverByName : Scalar<Driver>
    {
        public DriverByName(string name)
        {
            ContextQuery = c => c.AsQueryable<Driver>().Single(x => x.Name == name);
        }
    }

If we want to query a collection of entities, that is as simple as changing the base class our query object inherits from.

    public class DriversByName : Query<Driver>
    {
        public DriversByName(string name)
        {
            ContextQuery = c => c.AsQueryable<Driver>().Where(x => x.Name == name);
        }
    }

Built into the framework is the ability to fire off commands that affect the database but don't return a value. The syntax is very similar.

    public void RemoveDriversByName(string name)
    {
        _repository.Execute(new RemoveDrivers(name));
    }

    public class RemoveDrivers : Command
    {
        public RemoveDrivers(string name)
        {
            ContextQuery = c =>
            {
                foreach (var driver in c.AsQueryable<Driver>().Where(x=>x.Name == name))
                {
                    c.Remove(driver);
                }
                c.Commit();
            };
        }
    }
